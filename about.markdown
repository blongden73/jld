As an independent designer, I am always looking to diversify my portfolio and experiences. My freelance business started in 2016 when I was designing brand identities for companies big and small. Along the way I have collaborated with creative agencies, Fortune 500 companies, and recently added Art Directing to the mix. I am passionate about my work and take great pride and care in every project whatever the scope.
