About large description: "I’m Jacqueline - an independent designer and art director
  with a keen eye for fashion, beauty, activewear, food and beverage, and most recently,
  the NFT space. Over the past decade exploring the creative industry, I’ve developed
  a constant drive for diversifying my portfolio – enabling me to hone my skills while
  gaining valuable, well-rounded expertise. \n\nMy design business blossomed nearly
  a decade ago, when I began ideating and designing identities for companies both
  big and small. Since then, I’ve collaborated with creative agencies, small startups,
  Fortune 500 companies and beyond. \n\nWith a lifelong passion for art and design,
  I discover inspiration everywhere I go. \n\nReady to collaborate? [Let’s connect](#contact)."
