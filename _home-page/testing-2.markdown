Seaworthy is an organic jewelry brand committed to creating long lasting products made with intention. I was brought on to art direct a campaign shoot. With the brand’s point of view as the inspiration, I deliberately chose to cast, style and locate the shoot in a setting that felt natural while also elevated.
