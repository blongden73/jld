An organic jewelry line committed to creating long lasting products, Seaworthy is a brand made with intention. I teamed up with the brand to art direct their campaign shoot. With the brandâ€™s point of view as the inspiration, I casted, styled and scouted the location of the shoot in order to make it feel natural and elevated.
