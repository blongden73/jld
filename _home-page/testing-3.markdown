All Access is a Bandier line known for high-compression and high-performance workout apparel. I reworked the brand identity, including new typefaces, logo, and logo patterns. The first drop was for the All Access Fleece collection and soon after the second drop for the All Access Ribbed line collection. My logos and patterns are featured on both the physical product and across Bandierâ€™s physical and digital footprint.
