For the launch of the BANDIER Sustainability Edit, I designed & developed an identity to run across all campaign content. The identity aims to reflect the ethos of sustainable activewear and the launch of a capsule collection made from recycled yarn. The design looks at how technology can be used in a positive way to help with sustainability. I wanted the design to bring a bold and bright look, steering away from the traditional view that sustainble needs to be earthy and plain.
