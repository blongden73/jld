My debut in the NFT space, I art directed Leisure Project’s concept from start to finish. Everything from preliminary ideating to designing backgrounds and product cans, I helped maintain the brand’s identity while also driving its own path in the NFT world. Leisure Project’s website was also designed and built by myself – I created a space that’s thoughtful for both purchasing the brand’s beverage and also exploring its NFT.
